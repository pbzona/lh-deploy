# Phase 3: Test in Production

You're in the home stretch now! We hope you've learned a ton of heady, valuable, stuff so far about feature flags and the capabilities they enable so your team can ship more code without sacrificing safety in your deployments.

The functionality we've used so far may already have you questioning things. You might already be asking yourself questions like "If we can use LaunchDarkly to easily recover from a failure, and push users down different code paths with a few button clicks, then what's the point of our QA environment at all!" If not, then we gently urge you to consider this question.

We truly believe that the level of control, speed, and resiliency that our platform provides makes it possible to test your new features in production. Which, conveniently, happens to be the next capability we'll be discussing: **Testing in Production**.
