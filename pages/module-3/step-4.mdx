# Step 4: Re-Enable the Feature

Okay, last thing. Let's remove ourselves from the test group and turn the feature back on for Android users on app version 2.0:

Don't forget to save!

Great, now let's double check that the app is still working:

<BrokenFeatureModule moduleId="3" />

Looking good so far. Let's also be sure that our user base is getting the behavior we expect:

<UserTargetingModule moduleId="3" />

It's fixed! Amazing. And we were able to do all that purely by comparing a dev file to production and updating a fixing a dependency mismatch. Can you imagine how needing to recreate the issue in a QA environment would have been an extra, unnecessary step in this scenario?
