# Step 1: Investigate the Issue

Great, now let's regroup. First, we look up the details about one of the users who reported an issue in the users tab, and it looks like this:

Yup, that's the group of users wanted to release this feature to— and it worked when we tested in our development environment— so what could the issue be? Let's reproduce this ourselves to see if we can figure out what the problem is. We're going to turn the feature back on, but only for us, so first let's ensure that nobody is receiving the feature in production by adjusting our targeting rules:

Don't forget to turn the flag back on before saving

Okay, our flag is on but it's currently returning `false` for all rulesets. We grab an Android test device and login with our production credentials:

<BrokenFeatureModule moduleId="3" />

Everything is looking good. You check the app version and it's `2.0`, so this device should be able to recreate the issue.
