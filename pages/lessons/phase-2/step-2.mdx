# Step 2: Introduction to Flag Targeting Rules

Okay, that's enough about **evaluation contexts** let's see how we can use them. We've created a special helper function in `module03/index.js` that will evaluate your feature flag for each of the three users on line 51.

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="false" startingLineNumber={49} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`// Step 2:
// Add your feature flag to the variation call in the helper
async function targetingHelper(ctx) {
  const flagValue = false;
  return flagValue;
}`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

All you need to do is replace the `false` value inside of the `flagValue` variable on line 52 with an `ldclient.variation()` call:

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="false" startingLineNumber={49} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`// Step 2:
// Add your feature flag to the variation call in the helper
async function targetingHelper(ctx) {
  const flagValue = await ldclient.variation('release-axolotl-feature', ctx, calse);
  return flagValue;
}`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

If the above example matches your code in `module03/index.js` go ahead and save the file now.

Great! let's see what variation those users received for your feature flag:

<UserTargetingModule moduleId={3} />

Looks like they've all received the `true` variation, that's to be expected. Right now, our feature is on for everyone. That's because we've only got a `Default rule` set to serve true to all users when the flag is toggled on.

Let's try something diffrent. First, let's change the default rule to `false`.

Next, let's add a rule by clicking add rule under the `Target users who match these rules` header:

![target uses who match these rules plus highighted](/images/add-rules-button.png)

You may have noticed that 2/3 of the users in our earlier **evaluation context** example were Android users. Let's create a rule now that turns our feature on for Android users, but leaves it off for the iPhone user:

Our finished rule should look like this:

You may have noticed that the fields were autopopulated with potential values when you creted your rule. This is something we've done to make your life easierâ€” but what if your attribute values are sensitive information? Don't worry, you can keep the values of your attributes **private** if you'd like. Check out the optional content below to learn more:

<OptionalContent><h2>Private attributes</h2></OptionalContent>
Now that our rule is configured, let's save our flag.

Great! Now let's see which of our sample users receive the feature:

<UserTargetingModule moduleId={3} />

Fantastic! Only our Android users are receiving the feature. We've successfully performed our first **targeted rollout** with only a few clicks.
