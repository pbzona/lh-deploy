# Step 2: Introduction to Flag Targeting Rules

Okay, that's enough about **evaluation contexts** let's see how we can use them. We've created a special helper function in `module03/index.js` that will evaluate your feature flag for each of the three users on line[x]. All you need to do is add your feature flag on line[x] of the file like so:

If the above example matches your code in `module03/index.js` go ahead and save the file now.

[conditionally rendered upon save] Great! let's see what variation those users received for your feature flag:

<UserTargetingModule moduleId={3} />

Looks like they've all received the `true` variation, that's to be expected. Right now, our feature is on for everyone. That's because we've only got a `Default rule` set to serve true to all users when the flag is toggled on.

Let's try something diffrent. First, let's change the default rule to `false`.

Next, let's add a rule by clicking add rule under the `Target users who match these rules` header:

You may have noticed that 2/3 of the users in our earlier **evaluation context** example were Android users. Let's create a rule now that turns our feature on for Android users, but leaves it off for the iPhone user:

Our finished rule should look like this:

You may have noticed that the fields were autopopulated with potential values when you creted your rule. This is something we've done to make your life easierâ€” but what if your attribute values are sensitive information? Don't worry, you can keep the values of your attributes **private** if you'd like. Check out the optional content below to learn more:

[disclosure box with optional content about private attributes]

Now that our rule is configured, let's save our flag.

Great! Now let's see which of our sample users receive the feature:

<UserTargetingModule moduleId={3} />

Fantastic! Only our Android users are receiving the feature. We've successfully performed our first **targeted rollout** with only a few clicks.
