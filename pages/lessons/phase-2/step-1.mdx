# Step 1: Evaluation Contexts

You might remember that we mentioned something called an **Evaluation Context** back in Phase&nbsp;1. It's one of the required parameters to our `ldclient.variation()` method. We showed you this code sample, remember?

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="false" language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`const flagValue = await ldclient.variation(flagKey, userCtx, false);`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Or maybe not. It's okay, we're going to talk about it in detail now anyway.

For this exercise, you will be working out of `module03/index.js` click the button below to open this file now:

You may have noticed that the `context` parameter was actually a variable. You may have even noticed that the context variable was pre-defined as an object with a single attribute in the sample code for the module.

Well, the truth is, that `context` object could actually contain any number of attributes. It might look something like this:

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="true" startingLineNumber={1} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`{
    "key": "YOUR-USER-KEY",
    "firstName": "Bob",
    "custom":{
        "groups":[
            "COMPANY-GROUP-1",
            "COMPANY-GROUP-2"
            ]
        },
        "state": "CA",
        "early_access": false
}`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

The reason you might want want to add a few extra attributes to that object is to— you guessed it, **Target Rollout** of a feature at a specific group of users.

We've created a few contexts for you, each with unique attribute values, in `module03/index.js`. Go ahead and have a look at them now.

In this scenario, our **evaluation contexts** represent a user evaluating feature flags— which is why they have attributes such as `email` and `avatar` and `device_type`— but keep in mind that an evaluation context could also represent a machine, such as a specific server or cluster. Here's an example of what that user context might look like:

[code sample of server context]

We've populated these evaluation contexts with static values today, but this would rarely be the case in prouduction environment. Typically, LaunchDarkly users are already storing the values used to populate an **evaluation context** in some sort of state management system. Here's an example of what that might look like.

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="true" startingLineNumber={1} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`{
    "key": id,
    "custom": {
        "device": deviceType,
        "operatingSystem": osName,
        "browserName": browserName
    }
}`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

When implementing LaunchDarkly in a production environment, you'll need to consider where and when this information is available in your existing systems to use flag targeting rules effectively. Let's see how to set up flag targeting rules in the next step!
