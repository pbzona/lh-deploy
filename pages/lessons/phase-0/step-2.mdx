# Step 2: Add Your SDK Key

Our LaunchDarkly Client will need to know which feature flags to cache, and the **Targeting Rules** associated with them, before we can start diving into examples— so we'll need to wire our app up to our **Environment**. You can find additional explanation about LaunchDarkly **Environments** and **Projects** in the optional content below.

Let's find the SDK key for our LaunchDarkly **Environment** now. If you wanted to see the SDK Keys for each **Environment** within the **Projects** you have access to, you can do that from your **[Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects)**— but, instead of looking for our key there let's use a handy shortcut.

First, make sure you're in the correct project/environment

If not, switch to the correct project

Next, we'll use the **Global Search** keyboard shorcut: 

command + k (mac)
ctrl + k (pc)

You'll see the following pop up in your LaunchDarkly Project:

You may already see the option to `Copy SDK key for the current environment`. If not, you should only need to type the word `copy`, click the correct option, and select `Server-side key`.

This copies the SDK key for our environment. Go ahead and paste it below for safekeeping:

Now, let's store it inside of the `SDK_KEY` variable we've predefined on line 15 of `module01/index.js`.

Once again, make sure you use quotation marks! Line 15 should look like this:
