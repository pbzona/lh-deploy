# Step 3: Initialize the LaunchDarkly Client

Finally, we'll initialize the **LaunchDarkly Client** by passing it our `SDK_KEY` variable on line 18 of `module01/index.js`

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="true" startingLineNumber={17} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`  // STEP 3: Intialize the SDK client
  const ldclient = ld.init();`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Assuming we did everything correctly, the LaunchDarkly Client will initialize as soon as we save this fileâ€” all of your Project's **Feature Flags** and the rules associated with your **Environment** will be fetched and cached locally to your application.

To learn more about the architecture we use to deliver and evaluate your feature flags, check out the optional content below.

If you haven't already, go ahead and pass the `SDK_KEY` variable to the `ld.init` function on line 18 of `module01/index.js`. Here's what it should look like:

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="true" startingLineNumber={17} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`  // STEP 3: Intialize the SDK client
  const ldclient = ld.init(SDK_KEY);`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

We're almost ready, but before we save our progress, let's add a console log to our terminal output to ensure the **LaunchDarkly Client** is defined properly, since we'll need it for the next phases.
