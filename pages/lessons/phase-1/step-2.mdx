# Step 2: Add feature flag to code

For this and the following steps, we'll be making changes to `module02/index.js`. Click the button below to open the correct file:

[still not sure if this is possible, but button to open file]

For the sake of this example, let's imagine that saving the code in our editor is all we need to deploy our code to Production. You and I both know that isn't the case, but functionality we gain once we start feature flagging in our app is identical to what you'll see once we get our feature flag added.

On line [x] of `module02/index.js` you'll see a call to the `ldclient.variation()` method.

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="true" startingLineNumber={10} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`  // Paste your call to variation here:
  const flagValue = await ldclient.variation(flagKey, userCtx, false);`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This is the method we use to evaluate our feature flag. The method takes three parameters:

1. The feature flag key
2. The flag **evaluation context** (covered in more detail later)
3. The **fallback value** (the value that gets returned in the event of failure)

For more information on **fallback values** check out the optional content below

[optional content disclosure box]

For the sake of this example, we've taken care of teh **evaluation context** and **fallback parameter*** values for youâ€” all you need to do is add your feature flag key. The correct code should look like this:

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="true" startingLineNumber={10} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`const flagValue = await ldclient.variation('${getFirstFlagFromLocalStorage()}', userCtx, false);`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

If your code matches, go ahead and save your file. We'll show you what your flag evaluates to once you do:

<FlagKeyAndValue moduleId="2" />

[text conditional based on feature flag being added] Great work! Now that our flag is implemented, let's go ahead and turn it on. 

To do that, we'll head back to the targeting settings for our flag, toggle the Targeting switch to on, and click the save button:

 Now let's see what our flag evaluates to:

<FlagKeyAndValue moduleId="2" /> // Second instance on the page is not working, need to investigate this
