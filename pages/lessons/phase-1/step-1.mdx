Follow the steps below to create your release flag.

- From the `Feature Flags` tab of your **Project**, with the correct environment selected, click the create flag button:

- Give the feature flag a name, since this is a release flag, let's use the following format for the name: 
`Release: [unique word] Feature`
If you can't think of unique word, use your first name. If all else fails, here's one you can use:
[Generate a flag name for them]
- Notice the auto generated `Key` for the flag. This is how you're going to reference your feature flag in code once it's implemented. Keep in mind the flag key cannot be changed later.
- That's all we'll need for this step, we can leave the rest of our flag settings at default— but take note of the `Client-Side SDK availability` checkboxes, the return types in the `Flag variations` dropdown, and the `Default Variation` settings:

- Hit the **Save flag** button at the bottom of the screen. Once your flag is saved, you'll be brought to the targeting settings for your flag. Which looks like this:

- Click on the feature flag key located directly beneath the Flag name to copy it to your clip board:

- You can paste it in the box below for safe keeping:

<FlagKeyInput />

Let's be sure to leave the flag targeting settings open in our browser window, we'll return to them shortly.
