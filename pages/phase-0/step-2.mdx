# Step 2: Add Your SDK Key

Our LaunchDarkly Client will need to know which feature flags to cache, and the **Targeting Rules** associated with them, before we can start diving into examples— so we'll need to wire our app up to our **Environment**. You can find additional explanation about LaunchDarkly **Environments** and **Projects** in the optional content below.

<OptionalContent> <h2> Projects and Environments </h2> </OptionalContent>

Let's find the SDK key for our LaunchDarkly **Environment** now. 

If you wanted to see the SDK Keys for each **Environment** within the **Projects** you have access to, you can do that from your **[Account Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects)**— but, instead of looking for our key there let's use a handy shortcut.

First, make sure you're in the correct project/environment

![Project and Environment](/images/proj-and-env.png)

If not, switch to the correct project

Next, we'll use the **Global Search** keyboard shorcut: 

: `⌘ + k`

⊞: `ctrl + k` 

You'll see the following pop up in your LaunchDarkly Project:

![Global search box](/images/global-search-box.png)

You may already see the option to `Copy SDK key for the current environment`. If not, you should only need to type the word `copy`, click the correct option, and select `Server-side key`.

This copies the SDK key for our environment. Go ahead and paste it below for safekeeping:

<SdkKeyInput />

Now, let's store it inside of the `SDK_KEY` variable we've predefined on line 15 of `module01/index.js`.

<SyntaxHighlighter showLineNumbers="true" startingLineNumber={14} language="javascript" style={docco}>
{
`  // STEP 2: Define your SDK key
  const SDK_KEY = ''`
}
</SyntaxHighlighter>


Once again, make sure you use quotation marks! Line 15 should look like this:

<DynamicCode />
