# Implement the LaunchDarkly Client

Before we can use LaunchDarkly feature flags to separate our deploy from our release, we'll need to implement a **LaunchDarkly Client**. The **LaunchDarkly Client** establishes a connection to your **LaunchDarkly Project** and caches the Feature Flag set and **Targeting Rules** for your **Environment**. We will explain more about the bolded terms as we arrive at them over the course of the lesson, or you can click on them to be brought to relevant documentation in our knowledge base.


This will require the following steps:

1. Import the LaunchDarkly SDK
2. Add your SDK key
3. Initialize the LaunchDarkly Client
4. Verify it's working

In order to complete these steps, we'll need to be able to **log in to LaunchDarkly and access a project**. Your default project should work fine, assuming it's not currently in use. For later steps, we'll also need the ability to **create LaunchDarkly feature flags**â€” so you may want to make sure you can do that before you dive in.

Along the way, we'll be sure to explain useful LaunchDarkly concepts that support your required capabilities.
