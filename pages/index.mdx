# Introduction

Hey there, [company name]! Welcome to your LaunchDarkly North Star training.

Today, you're going to learn how you can use LaunchDarkly's feature management system to improve your software development practices.

The professional services team at LaunchDarkly has tailored this application to demonstrate the core capabilities you would like to improve within your team. Each example provided will be delivered through an interactive code sample in your native programming language, like the one below:

This training is meant to be hands-on and interactive; in addition to this application, you should have received instructions on how to access a backend application that we'll be using to illustrate common SDK usage patterns. This backend application also includes a web server that we'll query from this application to give you feedback on whether you're completing the lessons correctly.

When you start up the backend application, you should see a URL. Please enter it below:

<APIServerInput />

Over the course of this training, we'll use the LaunchDarkly SDK and Feature Flags to address the following topics

- Separating Deploy from Release
- Targeted Rollouts
- Testing in Production
- Prerequisite and Keystone Flags

We hope you'll find something new and exciting within! Let's get started.
